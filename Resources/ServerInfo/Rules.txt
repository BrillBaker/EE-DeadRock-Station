﻿[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 16 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON DEADROCK SERVERS. ANY USERS SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 16 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#bb00bb]This is the only source of server rules that apply here, which ideally has all the information any regular player should need. Please do not ever hesitate to ask either an Admin in[/color] [color=#DC143C]AHelp (F1)[/color][color=#bb00bb] or in the Discord server if you ever want clarification on the rules.[/color]

We do not have a wiki, instead, we have or will have all the needed information available via Guidebooks (NumPad0), such as how to power the station. If we do not have some bit of information (how to do a job or how specifically to execute something a document says) you may ask an admin via [color=#DC143C]AHelp (F1)[/color] or ask other players via the [color=#66bbff]OOC[/color] or [color=#66e0e0]LOOC[/color] chat channels.

[color=#ffff00]DeadRock is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job, interacting with your fellow crewmates, and using roleplay as the primary vessel to play the game. MRP places less emphasis on “winning” and more on just telling a story.[/color]

[color=#ffff00]This server operates under a "Three Strike System".
	- Each rule violation can and will count towards your strikes.
	- Three strikes and you will face a punishment related to your third strike.
	- Strikes are reset every month, on the first host for the month.
THIS DOESN'T MEAN WE WON'T KEEP TRACK OF YOUR VIOLATIONS![/color]
Continued instances of server violations will escalate your punishments, until ultimately, you will be appeal-only banned.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] This is an English server, and you are expected to use English when communicating through any server-related channels.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Do not ignore the [color=#DC143C]AHelp[/color] or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (i.e. "hello?", "any admins?" - also called "asking to ask"), or sending messages of no substance.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Attempting to evade game bans will result in an automatic appeal-only permanent ban. Similarly, attempting to evade job bans will result in an appeal-only permanent ban.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow the server expectations
    - Do not cheat.
    - Do not abuse glitches and exploits. [color=#ff0000]We have zero tolerance for abusing exploits/bugs. If you’re not sure, ask an admin.[/color] Otherwise, please use the #bug-reports channel on the Discord to report the bug.
    - If you are banned from a role or department, you may not play that role. This includes seeking or accepting promotions into roles you are banned from.
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew while not being an antagonist (i.e. self-antagging).
    - Do not make yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for one specific crew member in a way that would actively detract from the other player's enjoyment of the shift.
    - Do not, as a crewmate, hide the nuclear fission explosive (i.e. "the nuke") in an impossible to see location.
    - Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance. Hostility to administrators in the relay will result in your removal.
    - Department strikes (ex: cargonia and any variation thereof), cults, and any other type of similar largely disruptive behavior are strictly forbidden. These activities are generally antagonist-only and all players regardless of antagonist status must obtain admin Central Command permission before engaging in this behavior (you are extremely unlikely to get permission).
    - AFK (aka SSD) and catatonic players are considered to have the same rights as a conscious crewmate.
    - End-of-round grief (EORG) is not allowed. This includes attacking, destroying, polluting, and injuring without reason *on the way to* Central Command. [color=#ff0000]Once the lobby summary appears, everyone is free game.[/color]
        * This also extends to the following:
            * Neutral parties, such as space dragons or sentient artifacts activating harmful nodes.
            * Attempts to block the docking ports or ports leading into Central Command.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Follow Chat Guidelines
    - Use English as your primary method of communication.
    - Do not spam.
    - Do not advertise.
    - Be respectful towards other players in LOOC and OOC channels, and avoid making others uncomfortable. This can range anywhere from starting arguments to personal attacks against others, depending on the context.
    - Do not use netspeak in character (i.e. btw, lmfao).
    - Do not use the Emotes channel to bypass an inability to speak. This includes examples like "motions for you to put parmesan THEN sauce on the spaghetti," "im friendly," and "huh weird looks like I can't type."
    - Use the LOOC and OOC channels properly. Don’t speak of in-character matters in those channels unless you’re asking questions related to in-game concepts.
       * DO NOT use in-character channels to bypass a lack of ability to use OOC/LOOC chats (e.g. "Huh, wonder where captain went? *OOC* He probably left to get dinner lol"). This will result in an immediate dewhitelist.
    - [color=#ff0000]WE DO NOT TOLERATE HARRASSMENT AT ALL WITHIN THIS SERVER![/color]
	- We have a specific set of rules and guidelines for the usage of Spacism. (Prejudice against specific species within a station)
	- [color=#ff0000]Disruptive Spacism[/color] (Disruptive Spacism is an automatic 3 day ban!)
		- Targeting a member or group of people within the server, harassing them, committing antag, or harming them due to their species choice.
		- Constantly harassing them over ANY text channel.
		- Using any form of -igga or -igger slurs.
	- Non-Disruptive Spacism
		- Calling a moth a "Fluff-head" or expecting them to be a bit mentally slow.
		- Fearing a lizard security officer, because they are emotionless and violent.
		- Being hesitant to work with a Spider as a Moth.
		- Being slow to trust an Oni.
	- All forms of Non-Disruptive Spacism can have cause and effects from round to round, however Meta-Grudging rules still apply.
	- [color=#ff0000]IF YOU ARE DEEMED TO BE ABUSING THE SPACISM RULES YOU WILL BE INVESTIGATED AND OR PUNISHED DEPENDING ON ACTION!![/color]

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Follow Metagaming guidelines
    - If you die and get revived, do not act on things you saw while you were dead.
    - Do not engage in meta-communications. This includes using chat channels outside of what is available in-game to communicate with other players in the same game.
    - Players are allowed to have in-character relationships (friends, enemies, or otherwise), however they cannot be used as a reason to grant or deny things based exclusively on having a relationship with one another(i.e. Meta-Friending).
    - You are allowed to have knowledge of past experiences with someone else in prior shifts. This does not give you permission to hold a grudge against someone that results in you treating them differently in an unfair way (i.e. Meta-Grudging).
    - Specific players who were antagonists in previous rounds must not be treated differently because of it.
    - Do not "Antag Roll." This is the act of joining rounds for the purpose of seeing if you joined as an antagonist, and leaving soon after if not. Players who have a history of this behavior will have their whitelist revoked and/or face a ban.
    - [color=#ff0000]Do not stream the current round to the DeadRock Discord.[/color]
    - Do not place players into cryosleep unless they have given consent to do so, they are fully catatonic, or they have been sentenced to preservative stasis. Always examine a character to double check if they are SSD or catatonic prior to placing them into cryosleep.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing about the game or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming" and it is strictly forbidden.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Don't "multi-key" (use multiple accounts simultaneously). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Don't rush for or prepare equipment unrelated to your job for no purpose other than to have it "just in case" (referred to as "Powergaming").

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Follow Naming Conventions
    - In-character names must fit the server standards of:
        * Doesn't abuse inappropriate phonetic word plays (Dixie Enormous, Sugma Clock, Slenda Mann)
        * Doesn't disturb roleplay
      OR
        * Is a result of random name generation.
    - The only exception to the above is that theatrical roles like clown, boxer, and mime are allowed stage names with some freedom, as long as it is not obscene.

[color=#a4885c]13.[/color] Act like an actual human being on a space station. Avoid use of text speak or emoticons [color=#bbbbbb]IC[/color], and do not refer to [color=#66bbff]OOC[/color] things like admins in-game. Remember that this is a roleplaying game, and people are expected to try to react to situations realistically, even if it's not the "optimal" thing to do. What's good for Roleplay > What's good for Gameplay.

[color=#a4885c]14.[/color] Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside the game without their approval (this is referred to as "Metagrudging").

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an antagonist is forbidden without admin approval (referred to as "self-antagging").

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for slipping you, use common sense.
    - Don't outright leave people to die if you get in a fight, make an effort to heal them or bring them to [color=#52B4E9]Medical[/color].
    - [color=#DC143C]AHelp (F1)[/color] the situation if you think someone is over-escalating.

[color=#ff0000]COMMAND/SECURITY RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]17.[/color] If you sign up for a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] or [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] role, you are expected to know the basics of the game, your job, and the job(s) you supervise, if any.
    - Don't engage in common troublemaker behavior and lawbreaking as a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] or [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] role.
    - Do not immediately abandon your position as a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] role and go do whatever you want instead of managing your department/the station.
        - As a [color=#334E6D]Command[/color] role, do not take over the jobs of others. The [color=#334E6D]HoP[/color] is not the [color=#DE3A3A]HoS[/color], for instance, and holds no direct power over Security.

[color=#a4885c]18.[/color] [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] should try to remain non-lethal and effect arrests, unless there is a great risk of loss of life.

[color=#a4885c]19.[/color] [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] are expected to answer for use of lethal force. [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] will be expected to effect arrests of criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used. [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] is strongly encouraged, but not required, to clone antagonists and effect a permabrigging or other sentence as deemed appropriate.

[color=#a4885c]20.[/color] [color=#DE3A3A]Security[/color] are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability, so as long as it does not come to an unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Detainees that die in custody must be revived, unless they have been legally executed.

[color=#a4885c]15.[/color] Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew, or the station at large to do so.
    - Brig times should generally not exceed 20 minutes unless the crime is permabriggable.
    - Security may choose to confiscate dangerous items (weapons, firearms) as well as items used to commit crimes or items that prove problematic in possession of the detainee (tools, insulated gloves, etc.).
    - Security may inspect PDAs of detainees and withhold them for the duration of detention, but can only confiscate them if they are obviously contraband. Suspicion alone is NOT sufficient for PDA confiscation by Security.
    - Security is prohibited from checking crewmates for implants without reasonable suspicion.
    - Detainees that die in your custody must be cloned unless they have been (legally) executed or have committed suicide.
    - Executions must be for a capital crime, used only as a last resort, and MUST be authorized by the highest ranking member of Security, who will answer to the use of execution.
    - Detainees in the brig have the right to know what they are being charged with.
	- Abusing your power to self-antag or to exert your will over other players, especially when proven frequent will result in a 2 day roleban, with each recurring offense increasing the timer up to a week, in which if you still violate this ruling, you will be perma role-banned and can appeal in discord.
	- Respect your respective chain of command:
		- A Detective may not issue commands to any security officers, however may ask for reinforcements and or assistance in their investigations
		- A Warden may not issue commands outside of the security department, but are also eligible to lead during times of crisis.
	- All suspects:
		- May not be interrogated without a lawyer, if a lawyer is present on station.
		- May not be beaten without valid reasoning, especially while in custody.
		- Receive healthcare and services while in custody.
		- Be read their rights at the time of sentencing.
		- They have the right to remain silent.
		- Anything they say can and will be used in the court of law.
		- A lawyer will be provided upon request, if available.
	- While the duration it takes to derive a suspect’s sentence does NOT count towards their time served, any and all cases in which abuse is reported will be investigated by administration, and punishments dealt on a per-case basis. (You will be forcefully re-assigned mid round, and further instances will result in a roleban. See above.)
	- [color=#a4885c]Playing security means that you are expected to perform at a professional level at all times, while on shift.[/color]
		- Being on shift, means that you are in full uniform, and or have your equipment belt on your person.
		- Performing at a professional level states that you refrain from personal insults, personal grudges, personal biases.
	[color=#a4885c]Laws: https://wiki.delta-v.org/view/Space_Law#top[/color]

[color=#a4885c]16.[/color] Command members besides the Logistics Officer are not permitted to leave the station on salvage expeditions.
